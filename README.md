- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @prtdev

Currently intrested n modifying anythin that is linux maybe uses Shell commands as base...


Specifically the boot system with anything but shell code .... Special thanks to ipo4g for his base and Geohot for his Motivation on Apfs DEvices...

Special Thanks for Linus for his kernel although my system boot loops... Oh Even android 11 can boot to fastboot if you flash latest SU binary..
